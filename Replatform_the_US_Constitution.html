<blockquote><em>If a tyranny has taken control of the American state, then the citizenry are legally and ethically bound to deplatform the tyrant, and replatform their Constitution.</em></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>First posted: <a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/1266338309862764545">May 29th, 2020</a><br/>
  <li>This version: May 30th, 2020
</ul>

<p>Here i make some formal claims regarding the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/">&#8216;Executive order preventing online censorship&#8217;</a> released by the White House on May 28th 2020.</p>

<p>This document from the White House goes down in history as marking:</p>

<ol>
<li>i. the collapse of American jurisprudence, in syncromesh with the global collapse of neoliberal monetarism</li>
<li>ii. the de-facto surrender of the American ancien r√©gime to the nascent hypercommons, for which the current web addressed by this document is the final proxy</li>
</ol>

<p>The time to deplatform an illegitimate executive in order to forestall tyranny was 2016.</p>

<p>We are now at the juncture where the only defensible course is to replatform American democracy.</p>

<p>This Executive Order invokes the authority of the Constitution, in a context in which this invocation invalidates both its claims, and the viability of constitutional law as currently practised. </p>

<p>American Citizens are legally and ethically bound by their Pledge of Allegiance to uphold the Constitution.</p>

<p>If a tyranny has taken control of the American state, then the citizenry are legally bound to deplatform the tyrant, and replatform their Constitution.</p>

<p>In Dec. 2016 <a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/810803734276083712">i claimed</a> the GOP had a distributed liability tantamount to treason: </p>

<p>Today, i amend this charge: </p>

<p>The liability tantamount to treason that has been accumulating since Nov. 2016 is distributed across all US Citizens.</p>

<p>To defensibly address this liability, all US Citizens must deplatform the illegitimate executive, and replatform their Constitution.</p>

<p>How can US Citizens replatform the US Constitution? By constituting a universal civil service.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/1211758430500851713">As i stated in Dec. 2019</a>: </p>

<p>If, as an American citizen, you are not actively enrolled in such a civil service by the end of 2020, you should consider your citizenship and constitutional protections voided, along with the jurisprudence that enacts them.</p>

<p>It does not matter if you have heretofore identified as Left or Right. </p>

<p>The division here is between being a Mayan-American Easter-Islander, or being the citizen of a valid polity with a conceivable future.</p>

<p>One public figure has been acting as a role-model of responsible citizenry in the 2020s: <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg">@GretaThunberg</a>.</p>

<p>By the moral force of these arguments and their declensions, in full public view of citizenries American and global, i call on:</p>

<ol>
<li>i. <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">@jack</a>, Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Thompson (CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes">@nytimes</a>), et al. to deplatform the illegitimate executive</li>
<li>ii. <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook">@tim_cook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai">@sundarpichai</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella">@satyanadella</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbezos">@jeffbezos</a>, et al., and their lieutenants and employees, to repurpose their organisations towards the formation of the national-global civil service invoked above</li>
</ol>

<p>There are 216 days left in 2020. </p>

<p>The moral burden that falls on the officers named above is already incommensurable, and growing by the day.</p>

<p>As for the rest of us, citizens American and Global, don&#8217;t worry: everything is going to work out fine.</p>

<p>The tyrannies in China, Russia, Brazil, and elsewhere will fall along with the one in the US.</p>

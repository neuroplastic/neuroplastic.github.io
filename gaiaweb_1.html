<h1 id="implementationofrealadaptationtoclimatechange">The internet and open web translate the adaptational mechanisms of evolutionary biology to planetary scale</h1>
<em></em>
</center>

<p>Suspiciously just in time, the major work of translating evolutionary biology to planetary scale has been recently completed. The essential forms and functions of a sustainable human civilisation do not have to be built, but already exist as the open web built over the global internet. In that it recapitulates evolutionary biology as a medium that allows for continual integrated adaptations across local-global scales, the open web itself is the essential form and function of sustainable human civilisation.</p>

<p>A corollary to this is that the apparent reversal of the net, from an open system with utopian promise, into a dystopian one of mass surveillance, results from misinterpretations of the web as subordinated under national sovereignty, when in fact it is organically super-ordinal to it. This is demonstrated in both the dissolution of the political classes in the informational flows of the net, and in the blocking of the open web by nations devolving to authoritarianism.</p>

<p>In this context, the metaphor of the internet as a planetary neural net that has grown over older social systems, in the same way the neocortex grew over the brainstem, cerebellum, and limbic system, is now formally concrete. The neocortex and evolution of the nervous system enabled organisms to dematerialise physical conflicts into symbolic social behaviors. This enabled social-political systems to perform these functions at geographic scales, which in turn has enabled the open web to perform them now at the global scale.</p> 

<p>We are now at a juncture where the political-economic ideologies of the 17th&#8211;20th centuries are revealed as different partial views of underlying bio-evolutionary trends. Self-ownership or self-sovereignty, for example, no longer resembles an ideological principle, so much as an essential component of network self-organisation. </p>

<p>In the 21st century, then, humanity only makes evolutionary and ecological sense as a nascent, distributed global brain, serving the self-regulation of the biosphere as a whole. The open web must now be literally understood as a globally distributed social superorganism akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physarum_polycephalum"><em>physarum polycephalum</em></a>, scaled up from the microbial to the global. </p>

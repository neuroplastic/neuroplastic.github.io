<blockquote><em>SARS-CoV&#8211;2 may constitute the evolution of an additional switching layer over human phenotypes, as a response to the overshoot of homo sapiens, in a transposition of the kind of evolved population-level action, over the entire class Insecta, we see in wolbachia.</em></blockquote>

<p>We call SARS-CoV&#8211;2 Wolbachia for humans, not in a literal sense, but in the top-down sense: </p>

<p>Wolbachia is a bacterial symbiont across roughly half all insects. </p>

<p>It can directly functionally change aspects of insect phenotypes, including their sex. In these senses, it is quite different from SARS-CoV&#8211;2, and indeed any virus.</p>

<p>What we wish to call attention to here is not the mechanism of wolbachia on individual organisms, but playing out across populations. </p>

<p>We are describing an equivalence between the changes wolbachia negotiates between an extremely numerous, distributed, and differentiated whole class of species, and the environment.</p>

<p>This equivalence is meant in the sense that wolbachia seems to be acting as an additional switching layer over intra- and inter-species phenotypes, across 50% of a globally distributed class of species.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV&#8211;2 has special properties which seem to be self-optimising for acting as such a switching layer, over the homo sapiens species:</p>
<blockquote>1. SARS-CoV&#8211;2 fragilises the organs, immune systems, and neurology of a percentage of cases<br/>
2. This fragilisation is mostly silent: more asymptomatic cases have been fragilised than there are symptomatic cases<br/>
3. SARS-CoV&#8211;2 spreads rapidly and asymptomatically, evading detection unless adequate randomised testing is in place<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>These properties combine into a primer for synergistic risk, not only immediately renegotiating the balance between an extremely numerous, distributed, and differentiated species and the environment, but setting up a persistent new layer for further renegotiations.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV&#8211;2 literally requires a new layer of coordination of heterophily and homophily among individuals and groups [1]. </p>

<p>It deeply breaks-up pre-existing boundary conditions of social behavior and reproduction.</p>

<p>It is causing more vulnerable and less-developed populations to withdraw into defensive authoritarian modes [2].</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It coincides with the artificial introduction of wolbachia-carrying strains of mosquitos in Sri Lanka and other dengue, Zika, and similar virus hotspots [3].</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, homo sapiens doesn&#8217;t (yet) require a bacterial symbiote to fluidise sexual phenotype. </p>

<p>This fundamental aspect of the new switching layer seems to have emerged primarily as a rapid cultural evolution in the generations after X.</p>

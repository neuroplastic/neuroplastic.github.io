<blockquote><em>Due to mounting existential risk, a programme of radically exclusive, involuntary social transformation to pre-emptively effect controlled die-back and institute involuntary population controls is underway.<br/>
</em></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>First posted: <a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/1280097436405510145">July 6th, 2020</a></li>
<li>This version: July 7, 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider that the answer to the question:</p>
<blockquote>If SARS-CoV&#8211;2 is of human design, was it designed to cure HIV, or to be a deniable form of involuntary population control? [1]</blockquote>

<p>.. is that it has no answer.</p>
<blockquote>[1] Covid-Like Virus Was Sent to Wuhan in 2013, Sunday Times Says<br/>
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020&#8211;07&#8211;05/covid-like-virus-was-sent-to-wuhan-in&#8211;2013-sunday-times-says</blockquote>

<p>Consider &#8216;statement X&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote>Due to mounting existential risk, a programme of radically exclusive, involuntary social transformation to pre-emptively effect controlled die-back and institute involuntary population controls is underway.</blockquote>

<p>Now consider this, <em>not</em> as preamble to claims that SARS-CoV&#8211;2:</p>

<ul>
<li>is of human origin</li>
<li>was designed as a deniable form of involuntary population control</li>
</ul>

<p>.. but, instead as a statement about social behaviors that are inexorably emergent in polities under chronic existential stress.</p>

<p>We think of wars and genocides as the ultimate moral and ethical failures of societies, but if we take the work of @Peter_Turchin, @VaclavSmil, Robert Sapolsky, Jared Diamond, @TimothyDSnyder, and others into account (or if we simply fully account for physics and biology), they look more like forced errors. </p>

<p>Consider that the above statement X applies to any population under chronic existential stress. </p>

<p>It has applied equally to Weimar Germans, Rwandans, Mayans, Easter Islanders, and the Donner Party. </p>

<p>Consider it further as a general axiom in ethology. Like displacement digging, or the variance in risk-seeking vs. risk-avoidant behaviors, it&#8217;s true of many or most complex species. </p>

<p>(@nealstephenson anticipated this in Seven Eves, showing how human populations surviving a hard rain adapt different methods of population control.)</p>

<p>Because the global situation is one of overshoot compounding via negative synergies into general collapse, an extreme form of social transformation that limits energy usage and population growth is unavoidable and must be considered emergent. </p>

<p>In 2020, this emergent social transformation began in earnest. It will continue to intensify until humanity has regained a sustainable balance within the biosphere.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV&#8211;2 enables this transformation, regardless of whether it is of human or natural origin.</p>

<p>Many or most aspects of this transformation are unpredictable, uncontrollable, and encountered and responded to without consciousness of it as a whole. </p>

<p>At this juncture, only two broad political programmes for navigating this transformation remain:</p>
<blockquote>(1) Radically inclusive voluntary social transformation to proactively mitigate die-back and pursue planetary homeostasis<br/>
(2) Radically exclusive involuntary social transformation to pre-emptively effect controlled die-back and institute involuntary population controls (hence all the guns and body armor)</blockquote>

<p>There is general awareness of and overt agreement for (1) among roughly half the global population at large, and among the great majority of the younger generations.</p>

<p>The social groups aware of and in at least tacit agreement for (2) are distributed among the roughly half of the global population identified with the political right, skewing towards a majority among older populations.</p>

<p>Neither the older half favoring die-back, nor the younger half favoring social transformation, are aware of having made a decisive or definitive choice regarding how to implement their preferences. </p>

<p>Most people in both halves are clearly hoping for some form of compromise or middle way. Such a middle course was conceivably possible before Reagan and Thatcher, but not likely after.</p>

<p>The forced choice between (1) and (2) explains the sudden destabilisation and breakdown of US, UK, and global institutions and political classes.</p>

<p>In 2019, a clear consensus emerged among rational actors that a global wartime effort is needed, with everyone on the same side, to prevent civilisational collapse from climate change. </p>

<p>Yet half of us are in the position of tacitly or actively promulgating deniable ecocide and genocide, &#8216;fighting on the side of pandemics and climate change&#8217;. </p>

<p>The rest of us must understand how that half arrived there.</p>

<p>We stated above that we are mostly not conscious of this transformation as we are navigating it. This unconsciousness has deeper ramifications:</p>

<p>The current ecocide and genocides are instinctual, hence unconscious, hence deniable, until they&#8217;re over.</p>

<p>Survival instincts at the pop. level have the <em>unconscious</em>, ethological focus of excluding and fragilising out-groups. </p>

<p>These instinctual motivations lead those on the right to opportunistically exploit unpredictable events, to further exclude and fragilise out-groups.</p>

<p>In the current context of ballooning global risks and negative synergies, this exclusion and fragilisation is tantamount to collusion in multiple genocides. </p>

<p>However, because this behavior is instinctual, it is largely unconscious, hence tautologically deniable until after the fact.</p>

<p>(Cf. Kafka, Russian literature, and Russian history since 1890)</p>

<p>During the critical phases of the ongoing and impending mass death events, the pivotal actions and inactions of states are inherently instinctual, pre- and sub-conscious, and hence cannot be directly addressed through existing institutions and legal means. </p>

<p>Existing institutions require rational actors and shared definitions and rankings of the outstanding risks in order to function - a state of affairs that no longer obtains, and is furthermore actively blocked by the global collusion of right-wing actors. </p>

<p>Existing institutions were formulated to compound local knowledge and value, and locally forestall tyranny, functions in which, after several centuries, they have finally failed. </p>

<p>They were not designed to compound knowledge and value on a global scale, nor to forestall civilisational and biospheric collapse.</p>

<p>Current national and intl. institutions cannot effectively prevent or respond to syndemics, pandemics, climate change, and genocides; cannot be made to do so; and cannot be effectively held accountable for failing to do so until too late. </p>

<p>Indeed, the choice of the right to enact programme (2) reflects this understanding. This genocidal programme is ethologically deniable and cannot be stopped through conventional means.</p>

<p>However, if we are not continue the universal cycle of making the fundamental attribution error, then we must conclude that this programme does not reflect an inherent wickedness or set of defects on the part of right-wing elites, but has in fact been forced upon them by the circumstances in which they find themselves.</p>

<p>Before a global open internet and web, the best response to overshoot that our species could manage was programme (2), typically manifesting overtly as war and covertly as economic subterfuge. </p>

<p>Now, (2) is happening under global klieg lights. It is being observed, by everyone, in realtime. Despite its deniability, it is undeniable. </p>

<p>This in turn is having the emergent effect of forcing (1): radically inclusive voluntary social transformation to proactively mitigate die-back and pursue planetary homeostasis.</p>

<p>An initial outline of (1) is <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/1278253563353935874">Here,</a> i compared SARS-CoV&#8211;2&#8217;s effect on humans to that of Wolbachia on the entire class Insecta.</p>

<p>Wolbachia is not an impediment, but a key to the successful function of all Insecta as a micro-drone layer serving global biospheric evolution.</p>

<p>Similarly: SARS-CoV&#8211;2 may not be an impediment, but a key to the <a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/1214864055736979456">successful function of humanity in serving biospheric evolution</a>.</p>

<p>Humans have evolved the capacity to gene-edit all life on Earth. </p>

<p>We may have already applied this capacity in an attempt at involuntary population control. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/1214864171726180353">Here</a> we claim the human capacity for gene-editing is an emergent exaptation for management of the transition to planetary homeostasis.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV&#8211;2 may have been designed by humans, but, in an enantiodromia worthy of Heraclitus, its actual effect will be to force humanity to not only self-regulate, but actively regulate planetary homeostasis in general.</p>

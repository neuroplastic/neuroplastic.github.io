<p>For collective decision-making to have any possibility of addressing current existential risks, democratic participation must be reconceived in biospheric terms, transcending historical spatial and temporal constraints.</p>

<p>This document frames a method for a post-state, post-institutional mode of governance, transferring the institution of collective decision-making from being subordinated under nation-states, to being super-ordinal to them.</p>

<h2 id="background:">Background:</h2>
</center>
	  
<p>The current level of global existential risks has broken our existing means of collective decision-making.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Westphalian&rsquo; system of nations represents a continuous evolution of the state, from its origins ca. the 8th millenium BCE (as best described in James C. Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Against the Grain&rsquo;), to the present moment, in which the global system of sovereign states is clearly at its end.</p>

<p>The scientific case for the nation-state system ending now was made in the Club of Rome&rsquo;s 1972 study, The Limits to Growth, which predicted a recognisable state of overshoot and collapse would begin between 2015-2030.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/limits-to-growth-was-right-new-research-shows-were-nearing-collapse">2014 study by Australian researchers</a> checked the validity of the models and prediction made in the 1972 study, and found them to have been accurate, at a scale and to a degree unmatched by any similar forecasts.</p>

<p>As of 2020, we could add a large bibliography of more recent studies that vindicate and extend the forecasts made in Limits to Growth. Instead, we will simply acknowledge that if the reader is rational and well-informed, they know full well that overshoot and collapse have begun in earnest, and that institutions are failing across the board to meet the attendent challenges and reduce the terminal risks.</p>

<p>It is also clear that the national economies and institutions of developed countries are at the tail end of their life cycles, and cannot be expected to change themselves through established channels. National governments are of course the central such institution.</p>

<p>Given the circumstances, the most rational course for any citizenry would be a revolutionary reframing of their systems of government and constitutions, to in turn enable the creation of new institutions designed to meet the current risks.</p>

<p>In the terms of direct and intentional action, this seems and indeed would be impossible.<br/>
In the terms of indirect, evolutionary emergence, such a reframing has already occurred, not within individual states, but for all states, as the open internet.</p>

<p>This is demonstrated in both the dissolution of the political classes in the informational flows of the net, and in the blocking of the open web by nations devolving to authoritarianism.<br/>

<p>The internet clearly constitutes a medium for coordinating human decisions on a global scale.</p>

<p>As such, it is the framework in which a post-state, post-institutional mode of governance is now emerging, through which humanity can finally meaningfully adapt to the present situation.</p>

<p>This understanding is formally framed <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>It follows that the chief error humans are currently making is to assume that &lsquo;the web as subordinated under national sovereignty, when in fact it is organically super-ordinal to it&rsquo;.<br/>
- <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#iv.brsustainabledevelopmentaljustice">source</a></p>

<p>Once this error is corrected, path to adaptation to climate change and related risks becomes visible. The task at hand is to transfer a sufficient percentage of humanity to this path, as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Despite the obvious threat to human and biospheric survival, this task is complicated by the fact that adaptive solutions cannot be pre-stated, but can only be attained through nonlinear means:</p>

<blockquote>‘Generating desired aggregate outcomes indirectly through the learning and adaptation of multiple interacting agents allows the system to adapt to novelty and leverages the combinatorial explosion that defeats Rawlsian institutional design.’<br/>
- Against Design - Kauffman et al. - <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#iii.brtransferablemobileandfungibleprivateproperty">source</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>We must think beyond the design of optimal institutions and even, perhaps, beyond institutions entirely.<br/>
- Against Design - Kauffman et al. - <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#v.brthefateofnationsandborders">source</a></blockquote>

<p>This document frames a method for a post-state, post-institutional mode of governance, transferring the institution of collective decision-making from being subordinated under nation-states, to being super-ordinal to them.</p>

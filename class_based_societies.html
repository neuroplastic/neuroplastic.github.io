<p>Since 2016, i have literally not been able to believe the actions of the right-wing elites in the US and UK.</p>

<p>(Properly counting both Republican and Democrat parties in the US, and Tories and Labor since Blair in the UK, as right-wing duopolies.)</p>

<p>In June 2017, i conjectured that the US and UK had become intentionally kakisto-fascist, because responsible internal risk assessment had determined both that the oversized states (BRIC, US, UK) need to be broken up, and that there was no overt way to achieve this:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/872041596916822016">The actions of Putin, Trump, &amp; the Brexiteers only make sense if they are intentionally failing to effectively govern</a><br/>
https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/872041596916822016<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time i publicly stated this, i meant it more as a counter-meme than an assertion of truth. </p>

<p>Observing the mass-manipulation of electorates via media, i reasoned that if the idea that kakistocracy was intentional became widespread, it could provide the elites with an &#8216;honorable exit&#8217;, avoiding violent revolution.</p>

<p>I was also hoping to communicate a framing of the situation to the more rational elites, so-called &#8216;adults&#8217;, that they could use to surmount the organised treason of their less rational conspecifics.</p>

<p>At this point, i discard this memetic conjecture as moot, and replace it with this straightforward hypothesis:</p>

<p>Class-based societies are self-destructing.</p>

<p>What we are witnessing ca. 2016&#8211;2025 is the unconscious self-destruction of those modes of human society which:</p>
<blockquote>X1. organise into social blocs in order to compete for resources<br/>
X2. are governed by static class and caste hierarchies<br/>
X3. are motivated to ensure their own survival and status by undermining that of other blocs<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>I previously stated that:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/1280098111038410753">Because the global situation is one of overshoot compounding via negative synergies into general collapse, an extreme form of social transformation that limits energy usage and population growth is unavoidable and must be considered emergent</a><br/>
https://twitter.com/mylesbyrne/status/1280098111038410753<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>.. Here, i assert that one form of this emergent transformation, is the unconscious self-destruction of social groups fitting X1-X3 above.</p>

<p>Note that such groups are not limited to right-wing political blocs, but encompass all social groups fitting these criteria. </p>

<p>Humanity is now choicelessly united in the face of overwhelming existential risk. This state of unity is not a conscious choice, but is ethologically determined. </p>

<p>Social groups that continue to enact the previous evolutionary programme of intergroup competition are unconsciously enacting their own destruction.</p>

<p>Under conditions of overshoot, populations act en-masse to rebalance the environment. This action is coordinated, yet still unconscious at the individual level. </p>

<p>This appears to be generally true across biology, with wars, culls, and other forms of die-backs arising in response to shifts in available energy, as described in the work of @VaclavSmil, @Peter_Turchin, Gail Tverberg, and others.</p>

<p>@TimothyDSnyder&#8217;s Black Earth describes this in the context of WWII. We posit that the outcome of WWII itself was an example of our general thesis here: the Axis attempted to pre-emptively win intergroup competition for resources, and were defeated by societies that rejected this second-guessing of evolutionary design.</p>

<p>&#8216;WWII with everyone on the same side&#8217; has already begun, and roughly 50% of humanity is already ethologically conscripted, largely without conscious awareness.</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#ii.bruniversalconscriptionintotheopenweb">Implementation of real adaptation to climate change 5/10:<br/>

<p>Evolution is foreclosing on the model of statically-classed societies. SARS-CoV-2 is only the formal notice that the foreclosure process has begun.</p>

<p>As per Tainter, Smil, et al., societies evolve as natural negentropic mechanisms of compounding the rate of return of energy gained for energy spent.</p>

<p>Societies that tie the mechanism of compounding returns to a fixed social hierarchy inexorably collapse.</p>

<p>Social hierarchies already compound resources by extracting resources upwards. When the mechanisms for compounding resources reach nonlinear rates of return, this is multiplied by the compounding mechanism of social hierarchy, leading to both ecological and social collapse via a process formally similar to cancer.</p>

<p>Societies that do not fix compounding wealth to hierarchy persist. Scandinavian, Dutch, So. Korean, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese societies have been recent examples of polities that maintained collectivity, although this is endangered both by external threats, e.g. being neighbors to China, and internal factors, e.g. as seen in the case of Sweden.</p>

<p>The reasons that such cultures maintained collectivity are deeply historical and invariably born of surviving local catastrophes - the mechanism of social evolution the 13th century Persian scholar Ibn Khaldun termed &lsquo;assabiyah&rsquo;. They are not directly transferable to any other polity, even before accounting for differences in scale.</p>

<p>While the path forward for human societies does require breaking up the static class hierarchies of post-imperial states, it furthermore requires a system of dynamic social hierarchies.</p>

<p>To access compound returns for the good of societies, humanity, and the biosphere, we must &ldquo;reculer pour mieux sauter&rdquo; - take a step backward to leap forward - by dissolving fixed class hierarchies, and only allowing them to reform as fluid, unfixed, emergent, dynamic social hierarchies.</p>

<p>The dynamically-classed form of society, where class is mapped to developmental needs distributed over scale, is already nascently here, synonymous with the global userbase of the open internet and web. Statically classed societies are dissolving, or self-destructing, on queue.</p>

<p>The 2020&rsquo;s will see local-global dynamically classed society grow to roughly 50% of the human population, while the ~50% remaining trapped in statically classed societies suffer their apocalypses.</p>

<p>As outlined <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#iii.brtransferablemobileandfungibleprivateproperty">here</a>:</p>

<p>At a certain point, the peers of dynamically-classed societies will be collectively more wealthy than the subjects of statically-classed regimes.</p>

<p>The mechanism of compound returns is no longer for human ends, but for planetary and biospheric ones. Biospheric homeostasis over time, measured scientifically, replaces previous economic theories of value. This is self-evidently the point economics has been evolving towards over the last 4 centuries: balancing the global household.</p>

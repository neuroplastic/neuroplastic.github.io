<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>  
</center>

<p>Last chance, humans!</p>

<center>  
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>  
</center>

<p>The upcoming US presidential election in November 2020 is on track to go down in history as the moment when humanity lost its last opportunity to collectively address overwhelming global risks, and sealed the fate of the planet.</p>

<p>As of August 1st 2020, any sufficiently informed rational adult, anywhere on the planet, does not need any further information to know that the previous statement is not hyperbole and probably correct.</p>

<p>At this juncture, national governments are chiefly functioning to enforce historical claims to resources as the private property of archaic social classes. The post-imperial national governments are collapsing into dysfunctional one-party states, because these historical claims are in the way of meaningful adaptation to the current existential risks.</p>

<p>The US is the clearest example of this, followed most closely by the UK and BRIC nations. All these governments have clearly demonstrated their incapacity to recognise and respond to current global risks, let alone correctly prioritise or implement such reponse.</p>

<p>This situation at last clears the space for a proportional and rational response to our collective situation, in the form of a new, globally-distributed political platform and constitution, for effective response to climate change and related risks.</p>

<center>  
<h2 id="basis">Scientific basis for The Gaian Platform</h2>  
</center>


<p>We call this the Gaian platform, because it is necessarily based in the one already-existing schema of hard physical and biological science that is capable of responsibly addressing our total biospheric risk.</p>

<p>The starting point and anchor for globally coordinated scientific response to climate change is best summarised by the paper:</p>

<p>Making Evolutionary Sense of Gaia<br/>
- <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31155421/">article</a><br/>
- <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31155421/">PDF</a></p>

<p>This seminal work achieves the fusion of materialistic, bottom-up, reductionist science, with top-down holistic synthesis. It is the one valid scientific approach that can provide the basis for resolving questions of correct distributions of resources to achieve biospheric homeostasis.</p>

<p>It furthermore functions as the cornerstone of the foundation for integrating the balkanised and corporatised academy (all STEM-HUM domains). (The rest of the foundation for this integration is also complete, and will be disclosed in forthcoming literature and knowledge-integration tooling.)</p>

<p>Constitutions will now be redrawn, so that the state, at all levels, is regenerated as the administration of land, water, energy, and other resources, as Commons, functioning as layers in a local-global open network that self-organises towards global biospheric homeostasis.</p>

<p>As an example of how Gaian biophysics naturally extends into, finally, responsible and coordinated scientific response to global risks, consider this short article re. SARS-CoV-2 (by the same author as cited above):</p>

<p>Could this pandemic usher in evolutionâ€™s next major transition?<br/>

<center>  
<h2 id="org">Political organisation of the Gaian Party</h2>  
</center>


<p>We call on all able and willing humans to become members of the Gaian party, or simply Gaians.</p>

<p>The Gaian Party will run for leadership positions in all national governments, that are still functioning democracies.</p>

<p>In nations where functional democracy does not obtain, which includes the US, UK, and BRICs, pro-forma political activity to influence standing governments and institutions will be supplemented by new national governments and constitutions, prepared to take immediate action upon the eventual or imminent collapse of the legacy systems.</p>

<center>  
<h2 id="const1">The Gaian Platform and the US Constitution</h2>  
</center>


<p>By 2016, it had became clear to all rational and sufficiently informed US citizens that their Constitution had been thoroughly eviscerated by subterfuge in the private interest.</p>

<p>A US constitutional convention has been necessary for the last 12 years; this has been universally obvious for the last 4.</p>

<p>While there is no such thing as &lsquo;an American&rsquo;, the majority of the peoples and cultures from all over the world that are the US citizenry -</p>

<ul>
<li>left &amp; right</li>
<li>upper, middle, &amp; lower</li>
<li>descendants of slaves &amp; descendants of slaveowners</li>
</ul>

<p>.. are seeking to fix their Social Order.</p>

<p>Social orders are fixed by their Constitutions.</p>

<p>US Citizens can avert violent revolution only by forging a New Constitution, and replatforming it through a new political system.</p>

<p>Because what is at stake is in the 2020 US Presidential election is not just the US social order, but:</p>

<ol>
<li>the global social order</li>
<li>human civilisation</li>
<li>biospheric homeostasis - i.e., <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#background:brthebiologicalbasisforworldgovernmentinthecontextofclimatechange">the ability of Earth to sustain life</a></li>
</ol>


<p>&hellip; until the US Constitution is replatformed, US citizens are in a legally liminal state, with distributed liabilities for both treason and abetment of climate/war crimes growing by the week.</p>

<p>Until their Constitution is replatformed, US citizens, by voting, are only making all this worse, and increasing the total damage and liability they are collectively responsible for.</p>

<p>While today there is no US or World Court that effectively holds US citizens liable for these collective moral and ethical failures, US citizens can be assured that future courts, whether they preside over marble or ashes, will.</p>

<p>In order to offset the aggravated risk they will perpetrate by voting in November 2020, US citizens must not demand, but simply begin, a Constitutional Convention.</p>

<p>But a legitimate constitutional convention is constrained by reason and the public interest - beyond what current jurisprudence can be expected to produce.</p>

<p>A constitution built on reason and the public interest now requires incorporating what we know about climate change and other synergistic risks.</p>

<p>Addressing these risks means that:</p>

<ol>
<li>debt</li>
<li>wealth</li>
<li>privilege</li>
<li>class &amp; caste</li>
</ol>


<p>.. must all be reset, in service of the social order.</p>

<p>This reset is not a choice. It is itself a natural law, as clearly established in the interdisciplinary union of History -> Biology -> Physics, and in the work of Vaclav Smil, Joseph Tainter, Jared Diamond, Peter Turchin, et alia.</p>

<p>Where we have choice is in how and when the reset occurs.</p>

<p>If the reset does not happen soon peacefully, it will perforce happen soon violently.</p>

<p>On the other hand:</p>

<p>A constitutional convention that satisfies these constraints, will in one stroke:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>nullify the greatest quantity of existential risk ever negated.</p></li>
<li><p>make possible again for social groups at Rosling levels 1-3, what America has always promised them - a good life for all - only now in the far greater context of climate change.</p></li>
<li><p>mark at last the end of that refractory period in which Keynes in 1930 said &lsquo;we must yet pretend a little while longer that fair is foul and foul is fair, because foul is useful and fair is not.&rsquo;</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All US citizens are about to knowingly participate in an election &amp; a political system that is clearly a sham of responsible governance.</p>

<p>A constitutional convention along these lines, will in one stroke give that system a defensible bridge to the future.</p>

<p>Americans have the chance to make the crash of the American duopoly intentional and relatively nonviolent.</p>

<p>If they manage that, they will be remembered as managing the transition to reconstruction, instead of blindly extending the duration and human cost of the crash.</p>

<p>Other nations, such as the UK, France, and Germany, will quickly follow.</p>

<p>In 2020, as in 1776, the only legitimate American government is a revolutionary one, and the only legitimate Constitution is a Gaian one.</p>

<p>If Americans embrace Gaia, the greater part of the current volatility afflicting their country will dissipate. Most of it is criminal fakery, after all.</p>

<p>If Americans don&rsquo;t embrace Gaia, history and biology will drag them down, kicking and screaming as they are now, and in the end, America will die not from guns or pandemics, but from heartbreak.</p>

<center>  
<h2 id="const1">The Gaian Platform and the US Presidential Election</h2>  
</center>

<p>Most critically for human and biospheric survival, the President of the United States elected in November 2020 should represent the Gaian Platform.</p>

<p>If no viable Gaian candidate (i.e. target) emerges in time, Americans should write-in &lsquo;Gaia&rsquo; as their vote of no confidence in the candidates of the legacy duopoly, and to indicate their demand for an immediate US constitutional convention, as outlined below.</p>

<center>  
<h2 id="articles">Articles of the Gaian Platform</h2>  
</center>

<p>The Gaian party is a globally-distributed political platform for holding national constitutional conventions:</p>

<center><em>  
<h3 id="a_1">1. Constrained by reason and the public interest</h3>  
</center>

<center>  
<h3 id="a_2">2. Incorporating <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#background:brthebiologicalbasisforworldgovernmentinthecontextofclimatechange">what we know about climate change and other synergistic risks</a></h3>  
</center>

<center>  
<h3 id="a_3">3. Not negotiating debt, wealth, privilege, class & caste, but resetting them</h3>  
</center>

<center>  
<h3 id="a_4">4. Into <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#iii.brtransferablemobileandfungibleprivateproperty">transferable, mobile, and fungible private property</a></h3>  
</center>

<center>  
<h3 id="a_5">5. <p>Enabling <a href="https://neuroplastic.github.io/climate_social_contract_2020.html#iv.brsustainabledevelopmentaljustice">sustainable developmental justice</a></p></h3>  
</center>
</em>

<p>Further articles may extend these basic constraints as needed to restore and manage planetary homeostasis. We start with three:</p>

<em>
<center>  
<h3 id="a_6">6. Conversion of militaries to self-organising Gaian global infrastructure engineering corps</h3>  
</center>

<center>  
<h3 id="a_7">7. <a href="https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Gaia">Gaia Before Galaxia</a></h3>  
</center>
</em>

All fossil-fuel based space exploration must cease until planetary homeostasis is achieved.</p>

<em>
<center>  
<h3 id="a_8">8. Global Religion</h3>  
</center>
</em>

<p>We said above that Gaian biophysical science functions as the cornerstone for integrating all STEM-HUM domains. This centrally includes all religions, cultural practises and traditions, and heritages.</p>

<p>E.g:</p>

<blockquote>  
The Sky-Father says:</br></br>  
<em>  
You have made my wife, your Mother, sick unto death.</br>  
Restore Her to health, or you may not come to Me (ad astra).</br>  
If She dies, I will sacrifice you, my children, over your Mother's dead body.  
</em>  
</blockquote>

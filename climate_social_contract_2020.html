<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_Nations_Charter">We, the undersigning generations of humanity</a>, here address all persons born in the developed nations after ~1960: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X">GenX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials">Millenial</a>, &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">GenZ</a> generations.</p>

<p>GenZ is obviously the last generation that will have grown up in traditional civilization - one with functional nations and institutions as we know them. </p>

<p>The succeeding generation born after 2012, the Utopians, are growing up without sustainable social institutions, economies, or a functional open internet.</p>

<p>In 2019, it became clear to rational actors that the negative synergies humanity faces imminently threaten human civilisation. By the time the Utopians are adults, civilization may have been become irretrievable. </p>

<p>The relationship of these generations to each other and to posterity is under both the extreme moral burden of the climate crisis, and the extreme duress of systemic resistances to meaningful adaptation to climate change, which clearly violate the letter and spirit of national and international laws and conventions. </p>

<p>Here we outline a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract">social contract</a> between these generations to coordinate their response to this situation.</p>

<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<center> 

<h2 id="i.brthebiologicalbasisforworldgovernmentinthecontextofclimatechange">I.<br/>The biological basis for world government in the context of climate change</h2>
</center>

<p>Nation-states have been captured by interests interpreting the global situation as one of zero-sum survival, following the same lines of instinctual reaction which precipitated WWII <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>. The scope of these reactive interests is to survive what they perceive as the collapse of human civilisation, and the subsequent global holocaust, bottleneck, or Jackpot, in which several billion humans lose all human rights and are in effect &#8216;deniably&#8217; murdered. </p>

<p>Apart from its moral failure, this interpretation of the situation is counterfactual. The bottleneck we face is one of planetary homeostasis and habitability:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If life emerges on a planet, it only rarely evolves quickly enough to regulate greenhouse gases and albedo, thereby maintaining surface temperatures compatible with liquid water and habitability. [&#8230;] In the Gaian bottleneck model, the maintenance of planetary habitability is a property more associated with an unusually rapid evolution of biological regulation of surface volatiles than with the luminosity and distance to the host star. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we fail to meet this challenge, which is the goal of the methods described herein, the Earth most likely fails as a life-bearing planet, full stop.</p>

<p>The alternative is to interpret the biological function of humanity not in the terms of selfish genes, but as an evolutionary mechanism designed to both trigger and manage the transition of the planetary biome to self-managing homeostasis.</p>

<p>Human capacity to adapt to climate change now requires the translation of the adaptational mechanisms of evolutionary biology to planetary scale (e.g. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>, <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a>). Humanity&#8217;s rapid proliferation, extraction of carbon into the atmosphere, development of a single integrated global network, and use of this network to recapture carbon, may be the very mechanism by which this translation occurs <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a>. </p>

<p>Suspiciously just in time, the major work of translating evolutionary biology to planetary scale has been recently completed. The essential forms and functions of a sustainable human civilisation do not have to be built, but already exist as the open web built over the global internet. In that it recapitulates evolutionary biology as a medium that allows for continual integrated adaptations across local-global scales, the open web itself is the essential form and function of sustainable human civilisation.</p>

<p>A corollary to this is that the apparent reversal of the net, from an open system with utopian promise, into a dystopian one of mass surveillance, results from misinterpretations of the web as subordinated under national sovereignty, when in fact it is organically super-ordinal to it.</p>

<p>In this context, the metaphor of the internet as a planetary neural net that has grown over older social systems, in the same way the neocortex grew over the brainstem, cerebellum, and limbic system, is now formally concrete. The neocortex and evolution of the nervous system enabled organisms to dematerialise physical conflicts into symbolic social behaviors. This enabled social-political systems to perform these functions at geographic scales, which in turn has enabled the open web to perform them now at the global scale. The globally distributed polis must now be understood as a superorganism akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physarum_polycephalum"><em>physarum polycephalum</em></a>, scaled up from the microbial to the global. In the 21st century, humanity only makes evolutionary and ecological sense as a nascent, distributed global brain, serving the self-regulation of the biosphere as a whole.</p>
<center> 

<h2 id="ii.bruniversalcitizenryintheopenweb">II.<br/>Universal citizenry in the open web</h2>
</center>

<p>The primary function of a world government is not to centralise, but to fractally redistribute, the sovereignty abnegated by nation-states. Adaptive social response to climate change therefore hinges on portable identity in the open web, not as an extension of national identity, but as a form of constitutional citizenship for autonomous agents in a self-organising local-to-global polity. </p>

<p>World government, with power over national and regional sovereignties, is not constituted by any centralised or representative authority, but aggregates and emerges from the actions of voluntary global citizens (peers of the open web).</p>

<p>By the end of 2020, identity in the web will be equivalent to a constitutionally viable universal citizenship.</p>

<p>This form of identity will be universally available to all people, regardless of national citizenship, class, and educational and material attainment. </p>

<p>This form of identity is the sole constituency from which world government arises, as the fractal redistribution of the sovereignty that has dissolved at the nation-state level over local-global scales. </p>

<p>This form of identity is what will enable every act of openness &amp; temporary zone of autonomy to &#8216;automatically&#8217; connect into fluid and dynamic larger wholes, able to counter the power of closed networks, and defeat the ancient art of divide and rule.</p>
<center> 

<h2 id="iii.bruniversalconscriptionintotheopenweb">III.<br/>Universal conscription into the open web</h2>
</center>

<p>In general terms, this contract defines the conscription of all humans born in developed nations after 1960 into a form of universal citizenship that asserts sovereignty over nations and other legacy institutions and organisations.</p>

<p>Most humans find themselves morally, ethically, and rationally compelled to participate in the social contract in effect in their environment. All humans born in developed nations after 1960 should consider themselves already conscripted. </p>

<p>This social contract is militaristic in the broadest senses of universal conscription, mobilisation, and redistribution of resources. However, where national conscription is predicated as the total cooperation of one group vs. other groups in defense of fixed property, here it takes the opposite form of a universal redistribution of cooperation and property, in order to make ethical response to climate change possible.</p>

<p>To achieve this function, universal conscription primarily takes the form of personal data endpoints representing every living human being in the open web.</p>

<p>These endpoints collect information relevant to the individual, separately from any national, political, or commercial interests. They instead serve the goals of enabling the individual to transcend being the subject of nation-states and other forms of exclusionary power and property, and become an autonomous agent in a globally distributed system prioritising, in order of legal precedence: </p>

<h3 id="sustainabledevelopmentaljusticegoals:">Sustainable developmental justice goals:</h3>

<p>a. <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Human Rights</a><br/>
b. Effective collective responses to climate change<br/>
c. <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030.html">Sustainable Development</a>, and de- or un-growth<br/>
d. These articles, as a system of developmental justice</p>

<p>Building upon the legal basis initiated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">EU GDPR</a>, the raw information collected at these endpoints are encrypted and can only be privately accessed by the individual they describe. Further use of these data are possible only with both:</p>

<p>i. the consent of the individual<br/>
ii. the use relying on the secondary form of the result of a query using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">secure function evaluation</a> </p>

<p>Private personal data as described here enables the universal deployment of machine learning (ML) and related methods as direct extensions of the cognition and capabilities of the individual. The open web can then fulfill its potential to solve the wicked problems of both social coordination and developmental justice. This potential reaches beyond stigmergy, to the web in effect functioning as exogenous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum">corpus callosa</a> between individuals.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of this social contract, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class">social classes</a> are hereby dissolved and reorganised into: </p>

<p>a. Voluntary universal citizens (peers of the open web)<br/>
b. Potential universal citizens (users of the open web)<br/>
c. Conscientious objectors to universal citizenship (nonusers of the open web)</p>

<p>N.B:</p>

<p>i. Subjects of states in which the open web is blocked cannot function as global citizens, unless they can use non-state sanctioned means to access the open web</p>

<p>ii. Members of states where the web is open, yet whose use of the web is mediated by private corporations, cannot function as global citizens, unless they use non-private means to access the open web</p>

<p>iii. Voluntary membership in organisations, institutions, and political parties defined within national sovereign frameworks is not automatically a form of conscientious objection, depending on how such membership aligns with the cascades of rights and responsibilities flowing, in both directions, from global to local levels of federated sovereignty</p>

<h3 id="peersoftheopenweb">Peers of the open web</h3>

<p>Individuals who interact with their endpoints in ways formally and continually consistent with the sustainable developmental justice goals above, constitute themselves as peers of the open web. </p>

<p>Peers of the open web:</p>

<p>a. are automatically supported in the basics of survival, and in their personal development<br/>
b. are automatically provided instantiations of their rights to private property and resources, as they require and as the open web is able to provide<br/>
c. are not required to hold jobs, titles, and fixed material possessions, but are on the contrary required to hold themselves free of such, in order to fluidly function as peers</p>

<h3 id="usersoftheopenweb">Users of the open web</h3>

<p>Individuals who interact with the endpoints mapped to their identities in ways eventually consistent with the sustainable developmental justice goals above, constitute themselves as users of the open web. </p>

<p>Users of the open web:</p>

<p>a. may request and receive benefits from the open web, as the web is able to provide them<br/>
b. the open web seeks in all cases to help them and their environments develop the capacity to function as peers</p>

<p>An example of users of the open web are persons who still hold material possessions, such as land, as private property, and/or full-time jobs in legacy economies, yet voluntarily engage with their personal endpoints in the open web.</p>

<h3 id="non-usersoftheopenwebconscientiousobjectors">Non-users of the open web / conscientious objectors</h3>

<p>Some individuals born after 1960 want to become global citizens. Some do not. Some individuals born after 1960 want to see the UN Declaration of Human Rights and SDGs become guaranteed by an actual world government, with power over national and regional sovereignties, while some are afraid that such a development would become a world tyranny. </p>

<p>All individuals are free to conscientiously object to conscription into global citizenry, and exclude themselves from the attendent rights and duties.</p>

<p>However, whereas conscientious objection from conscription into service has traditionally meant leaving one&#8217;s nation of origin, conscientious objection to this conscription means remaining primarily identified as a subject of one&#8217;s nation of origin.</p>

<p>Individuals who choose not to interact with their endpoints, constitute themselves as non-users of the open web. </p>

<p>Non-users do not receive benefits from the open web, but may where necessary receive services in order to avoid harm to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life">LifeWeb</a>.</p>

</center>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;[W]e should [..] view institutions as webs of enabling constraints that may create rich or poor adjacent possibilities for agents in the system. Redundancy, degeneracy, adaptivity, diversity, &amp; resilience may better predict performance in unforeseen situations. Generating desired aggregate outcomes indirectly through the learning and adaptation of multiple interacting agents allows the system to adapt to novelty and leverages the combinatorial explosion that defeats Rawlsian institutional design.&#8217;<br/>
 - Against Design - Kauffman et al. <a href="#fn:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the overdeveloped world, identity and social position is tied to what we can claim as exclusive property. The very notion of property and wealth is rooted in excluding others from use. </p>

<p>Personal and private property is a fundamental necessity for healthy development. Yet if this property has to be material, fixed and exclusionary, humanity cannot afford it.</p>

<p>No developed country meets the basic needs of its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. In 2019 it became clear that there is no longer any possibility that any nation <em>could</em> meet those needs without transgressing planetary boundaries. </p>

<p>Note that these are basic needs only: the biological requirements for human survival, e.g. air, food, drink, shelter, clothing, and basic security. Goals higher up Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy would require levels of resource use 2–6 times the sustainable level. <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>

<p>However, if personal, organisational, and institutional property must be transferable, mobile, and fungible, there is not only enough for the basics, but the flow of resources can occur so as to distribute development and actualisation according to Rawls&#8217; and Amartya Sen&#8217;s theories of justice.</p>

<p>Each peer in the open web is a co-owner and operator of the open web and its systems. As such, their private property is a continual distribution of fungible resources to them, as needed and available. </p>

<p>This in effect constitutes an economic system where property is simultaneously private and public wealth at the same time. This enables social coordination of resources to become recursive across personal-to-social, and local-to-global scales. The result is that each peer, holding no land or fixed physical property, is in both functional and legal terms more wealthy than the wealthy elites, whose property is predicated on exclusionary power. </p>

<p>This shifts the primary locus of both personal identity and economic value from being rooted in private, exclusionary property, to being rooted in human rights, sustainable de- or un-growth, and developmental justice.</p>
<center> 

<h2 id="v.brsustainabledevelopmentaljustice">V.<br/>Sustainable developmental justice</h2>
</center>

<p>If resources are to be distributed to effectively adapt to climate change, rule of law must be maintained, not through military force, but through universal provision of developmental justice. </p>

<p>The starting point of Rawl&#8217;s theory of justice is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance">veil of ignorance</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If each individual in society were to base their practices off the fact that they could be the least advantaged member of society &#8230; freedom and equality could possibly coexist in a way that has been the ideal of many philosophers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This social contract makes the veil of ignorance concrete: </p>

<p>Each citizen participates at each level of society.</p>

<p>The primary function of a world government is not to centralise, but to fractally redistribute, the sovereignty abnegated by the members of the nation-state system. Sovereignty is fractally redistributed over local-global scales, by distributing the rights and responsibilities of all citizens equally over local-global scales. Each citizen must participate at each nested scale of federated social organisation. </p>

<p>A peer is automatically a member of social networks at each level of scale. They do not have to earn or hold a position in each such social network, as the roles and work at each scale is dynamic and emergent. They do not carry status or rank from one level to the next. They carry instead their unique personal experiences at all levels, to each level in turn. They just have to show up. </p>

<p>This is a self-organising form of federalism that is both bottom-up and top-down:</p>

<p>The federation of social networks of autonomous agents in an open web is legally constituent of the federation of political sovereignty, which in turn is the legal mechanism for the balanced redistribution of resources in adaptation to climate change. The rights and responsibilities of individuals and organisations now flow in both directions, from local to global levels of federated sovereignty. </p>

<p>In this social contract, the uneducated tribeswoman has as much distributed property and duties at the global scale, as the PhD of political science, who in turn has as much distributed property and duties at the local level as the tribeswoman. The welder from a flyover state finds herself mediating between warring regional tribes on another continent. The Goldman-Sachs trader finds himself dredging an irrigation canal. The algorithmic variation in scale and role never ceases, ratcheting both individual and social development with each movement. </p>

<p>This dissolves the apparent left-right dichotomy of politics at the national scale. The circulation of all citizens through all local-global levels solves the wicked problems of both social coordination and developmental justice<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a>. </p>

<h3 id="thefateofnationsandborders">The fate of nations and borders</h3>

<p>Beginning ca. the 16th century, sovereignty coagulated at the nation-state level. In the late 20th century, it began to dissolve. As of 2020, the largest developed nations have effectively regressed to one-party states. The regression of national governments to authoritarianism is not a continuation of legal sovereignty, but the abnegation of it. In the face of climate change, the sovereignty of nation-states is formally void. </p>

<p>Nation-states are closing their borders in reaction to the climate crises, seeking to protect pre-existing distributions of private property and &#8216;ways of life&#8217;. This social contract does not do away with borders, but reinterprets them as now necessarily fluid and algorithmic in nature.</p>

<p>Algorithmically dynamic bordering of social networks at nested local-global scales dissolves the borders we inherit from the 20th c., but both re-asserts and mobilises historical and regional cultures, languages, and traditions. Nations as we know them both devolve into subnational levels, and transclude into supranational levels.</p>

<p>The mobilisation of energy from the release of carbon into the atmosphere immediately requires the greatest mobilisation of humans and resources even undertaken. This is not mobility for some, but mobility for all. The former subjects of the overdeveloped nations are mobilised into the same streams, from global to local levels, as refugees from the underdeveloped ones.</p>

<p>Nations as we currently know them may take the path of facilitating these articles, and so extend their functional lifespans. However, as the geographical and economic holdings of nations as private property is the major impediment to meaningful adaptation to climate change, this is not likely. Appearances to the contrary are likely to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Climate_Change_conference">UN COP conferences</a> in being only appearances, and dangerously misleading ones at that.</p>

<h3 id="thefateofnationalists">The fate of nationalists</h3>

<p>Universal citizenship has always been framed as an ultimate goal of the far left. In one of history&#8217;s great reversals, it is actually being achieved by the far right.</p>

<p>Among non-elites, so-called nationalists, populists, and right-wingers are the historical vanguard of recognition of the non-viability of nation-states. In rejecting remote systems of control, <em>even or especially where such rejection has led to authoritarian capture of formerly democratic governments,</em> they have precipitated the downfall of the nation-state system.</p>

<p>Universal citizenship does not mean leaving religion, culture, family, and tribe behind. On the contrary, it is the sole means of carrying heritage and culture safely into the future.</p>

<p>So-called nationalists, populists, and right-wingers seek to preserve their heritage and follow their own lines of personal and social development. By shattering the stasis of the Westphalian system, the people of the right have made it possible for themselves and all peoples to do so. </p>

<p>To claim this possibility and ensure the survival of their cultures and bloodlines, they have to relinquish previous claims to fixed land and property, and recreate their cultures as societies of free-agents in the open web. If they do this, they can claim the victory over history, the continuity of their heritage through the bottleneck, and, finally, no more and no less than their just share in the common wealth of humanity. </p>

<h2 id="apologytosirtimberners-leeetal.">Apology to Sir Tim Berners-Lee et al.</h2>

<p><em>To Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the IETF, the Apache Software Foundation, and all developers and supporters of the W3C Web Platform and related efforts:</em></p>

<p>Your selfless labors on the behalf of humanity have provided the key to solving the climate crisis. Over the course of 2020, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform">web platform</a> will be used to implement these articles.</p>

<p>While it now seems likely that what is described here is the evolutionary function of the web platform you have collectively created, it is nevertheless an alarming second reframing of your work.</p>

<p>The first reframing of your work was the reversal of the net, from an open system with utopian promise, into a dystopian one of mass surveillance, in which the old principle of &#8216;divide and govern&#8217; became hyper-powered. </p>

<p>The extreme reframing of your work described here is a necessary correction, the abruptness of which which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_Nations_Charter">we, the undersigning generations of humanity</a>, apologise for. On behalf of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life">LifeWeb</a> your work resembles and extends, we thank you for providing the means for humanity&#8217;s self-rescue.</p>

<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>

<p>These five articles are the foundation on which real adaptation to climate change will proceed. Implementation details will follow over the coming months.</p>

<p>This subject is difficult, and you should feel distress and anxiety in considering its claims. But note that this document is not published in hope, but in recognition of what is already accomplished in the formally real circumstances in which we find ourselves, and in the hearts and minds of the vast majority of the addressed generations. In the shared recognition of what is described herein, it is accomplished.</p>

<p>Consider also that those who oppose what has been specified herein, through both legal and illegal means, have already checkmated themselves. Closed and authoritarian powers are being destroyed by their own nature, as the net allows them to reach the point of self-contradiction in months vs. centuries.</p>

<p>Remember that although this social contract is militaristic in the broadest senses of universal conscription, mobilisation, and redistribution of resources, there is literally no enemy. The net enables, and the situation requires, developmental justice for all people, regardless of ther beliefs.</p>

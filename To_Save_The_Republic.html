<h2 id="background">Summary</h2>
</center>

<p>If the Constitution and federal law continues to be semantically weaponised, then the Republic is lost.</p>

<p>Three reasonable measures can be taken by all US citizens, and the world, as a sign that nonpartisan faith in the Union survives:</p>

<p>To save the Republic, the Biden-Harris administration must:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Decisively end authoritarianism by disbanding the Republican Party through Trial</p></li>
<li><p>Decisively end neoliberalism by disbanding the Democratic Party through Constitutional Convention</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the US via Debt Jubilee</p></li>
</ol>

<center>  
<h2 id="i.-the-trial">I.<br/>Trial</h2>
</center>  

<p>The US needs to prosecute the Republican core, showing the world what will happen to the enablers of the next authoritarian figurehead.</p>

<p>This needs to be an actual trial, in the fullest and highest sense of the word.</p>

<p>Seemingly mistaking Tacitus' <em>Annals</em> for <em>The Federalist Papers</em>, the Republican party made a Roman gamble, and now must pay a Roman price:</p>

<p>This trial must decisively end authoritarianism in the US by disbanding the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Every procedural hole, all those aspects of governance that (it&rsquo;s now abundantly clear) require good faith, that Republicans have exploited, must become a penitentiary gate for those who walked through them.</p>

<p>This trial has to reach all the way down to AG William Barr&rsquo;s collaborators at state levels. A Republic in which the AG organises police chiefs, who in turn organise armed militias against the political opposition, is clearly in constitutional crisis.</p>

<p>A reasonable indicator that this trial has taken the full measure of the gravity of the situation will be that indicted public servants serve time in facilities directed and staffed by more recent immigrants and people of color.</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-disunion">Avoiding Disunion</h3>

<p>Such a trial will cause a percentage of the 72 million Americans who recently signed off on the Republican&rsquo;s policide to go postal.</p>

<p>A NYT exit poll found that over 80% of those 72 million do not believe climate change is a serious threat.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Fintan O'Toole <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, half of the voting population has reverted to a pre-democratic state.</p>

<p>The reasons for this reversion can only be meaningfully addressed by a constitutional convention, through which the Democratic Party will perforce be disbanded.</p>

<p>Before this can occur, the authoritarian formations of disordered power, which both victimise and are called into being by the pre-democratic population, must first be disbanded.</p>

<p>Under a functional Constitution and federal system, let alone under current existential risks, such authoritarian formations of disordered power cannot be permitted by any legitimate US government.</p>

<p>The US government must face what this means: taking a figurative lesson from the California fires, this tinder needs to be burned, in a controlled fire, before the inevitable next wave of authoritarianism.</p>

<p>The moment for this controlled burn, via the trial that disbands the Republican Party, is right now. This trial will by itself trigger the overdue Constitutional Convention.</p>

<center> 
<h2 id="ii.-the-constitutional-convention">II.<br/>Constitutional Convention</h2>
</center>  

<p>The Constitutional Convention triggered by the trial, in addressing the roots of US power disorders, will decisively end the dangerous economic inequality in the US (neoliberalism) by disbanding the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>To centrist arguments for the impossibility of this under a Democratic administration: this is not a statement of a given political mechanism, this is a statement of performative necessity.</p>

<p>The Biden-Harris administration must perform the disbanding of the Republican Party by trial, and then perform the disbanding of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The Republican Party substituted Tacitus' <em>Annals</em> for <em>The Federalist Papers</em>. The Democratic Party must in turn substitute <em>The Oresteia</em>.</p>

<p>What the Biden-Harris administration must perform, is the restaging of the Republican&rsquo;s Roman tragedy - through which the social order further decays - into a Greek tragedy, through which the social order is restored.</p>

<center>  
<h2 id="iii.-debt-jubilee">III.<br/>Debt Jubilee</h2>
</center>  

<p>The trial will trigger the Constitutional Convention.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Convention will result in the Debt Jubilee.</p>

<p>A debt jubilee is necessary to end the domination of the rentier class.</p>

<p>The jubilee performatively ends neoliberalism, e.g. by shredding the &lsquo;monopoly money&rsquo; and &lsquo;Landlord Game rules&rsquo; of neoliberalised finance.</p>
